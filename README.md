# AI Augmented Development Framework - Training Repository

This repository contains a hands-on step by step framework for teaching AI-augmented development. In an effort to teach a NEW approach to software development for so many people discovering AI Code Assistants, we put together this course. Each lesson is organized as a separate feature branch that builds upon the previous one and is taught by a live coach.

So many of the ideas around TDD and BDD are possibly more relevant now than ever before. Many software teams dont adopt TDD and comprehensive PRD creation because its time consuming and honestly almost impossible to implement effectively.

This course is designed to help you understand how to leverage AI tools in your development workflow effectively and wrangle AI Assistants to help you create better software faster.

## 📚 Training Structure

This training is designed to be completed in order. Each branch represents a specific lesson step:

### Lesson Progression

1. **Step 0** - `feature/step-0` - Foundation/Starting Point
2. **Step 1** - `feature/step-1` - Ideation and Planning
3. **Step 2** - `feature/step-2` - Product Requirements Document (PRD) Creation
4. **Step 3** - `feature/step-3` - BDD and Sceario Development (Business Driven Development)

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Revtelligent/ai-augmented-dev-framework.git
   cd ai-augmented-dev-framework
   ```

2. **View all available lessons:**
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```

### Working Through the Lessons

**Important:** Complete the lessons in order for the best learning experience.

#### Start with Step 0:

```bash
git checkout feature/step-0
```

#### Progress to the next lesson:

```bash
git checkout feature/step-1
```

#### Continue through each step:

```bash
git checkout feature/step-2
git checkout feature/step-3
```

### 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start fresh for each lesson:** Always checkout the specific branch for the lesson you're working on
- **Don't mix branches:** Each lesson is self-contained and should be worked on in its designated branch
- **Save your work:** If you want to save your progress, create your own branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout feature/step-1
  git checkout -b my-step-1-work
  # Make your changes and commit them
  ```

## 🔄 Switching Between Lessons

You can easily switch between any lesson at any time:

```bash
# Go back to review an earlier lesson
git checkout feature/step-0

# Jump to a specific lesson
git checkout feature/step-2

# See what lesson you're currently on
git branch --show-current
```
