## Below is a collection of raw, unorganized user feedback we have gathered:

[[Paste the raw, unorganized user feedback here. For example:
"The app is great, but I really wish it had a dark mode."
"Why can't I export my reports to PDF? This is a basic feature."
"Crashes every time I try to upload a file larger than 10MB."
"Your competitor, 'App X', lets users collaborate in real-time. We need that."
"The new update is confusing. I can't find the settings menu anymore."]]

First, analyze all the raw user feedback provided in the context to silently identify the most common themes and recurring pain points.

Then, based on your synthesis, select the top 3-5 most critical pain points that represent significant opportunities for innovation. For each of these critical pain points, provide a detailed analysis.
</action>
<format>
Structure your final response as a prioritized list. For each pain point, use the following Markdown format:

### 1. [Pain Point Name]

**Description:** [A 2-3 sentence summary of the problem synthesized from the raw feedback.]
**Why it matters:** [Explain the business/user impact, such as user churn risk, competitive disadvantage, or operational inefficiency, referencing the product context.]
**Opportunity Size:** [High/Medium/Low, with a one-sentence justification.]
**Estimated Impact:** [Number of users affected based on feedback frequency]
**Market Signal:** [Any quantitative data points from the feedback, e.g., "mentioned by 40% of reviewers"]

[Repeat for the top 3-5 pain points]

- Your analysis must be derived directly from the raw feedback provided.
- Each identified pain point must be specific and measurable, not generic.
- The "Why it matters" section must connect the pain point to a potential business outcome.
- Do not just list complaints; provide a strategic assessment of them.
