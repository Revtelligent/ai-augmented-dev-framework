The Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle is now complete. Let's validate the actual frontend implementation with E2E tests.

I have provided the original User Story file that was used for the TDD implementation.

E2E VALIDATION Phase:

**SETUP:**

1. Ensure development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Create Playwright test: `tests/e2e/[feature-name].spec.js`

**E2E TEST REQUIREMENTS:**
Write Playwright tests that validate each scenario from the User Story:

- Test every Given/When/Then scenario described
- Verify actual user interactions work as specified
- Check visual layout and positioning requirements
- Validate responsive behavior across device sizes
- Confirm performance requirements are met
- Take screenshots for visual validation

**VALIDATION APPROACH:**

- Each User Story scenario should become a separate test case
- Test real user workflows, not just component behavior
- Verify acceptance criteria are actually met in the browser
- Check edge cases mentioned in the scenarios

**DELIVERABLES:**

1. Complete Playwright E2E test file covering all scenarios
2. Screenshots showing the implementation in action
3. Test results report - pass/fail for each scenario
4. Documentation of any issues found

Run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/[feature-name].spec.js --headed`

If any scenarios fail, document the specific issues for follow-up fixes.
