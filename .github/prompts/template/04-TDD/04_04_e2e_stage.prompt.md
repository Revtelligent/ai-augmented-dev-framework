The Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle is now complete. Let's validate the actual frontend implementation with E2E tests.

I have provided the original User Story file that was used for the TDD implementation.
[USER_STORY]

E2E VALIDATION Phase:

**IMPORTANT:** This is for visual validation only. DO NOT create new components, routes, or modify existing functionality. Unit and integration tests already cover component behavior.

**ASSUMPTIONS:**

- All components and functionality already exist from the TDD implementation
- You are only testing what was already built
- If something doesn't work, report it - don't fix it in this phase

**SETUP:**

1. Ensure development server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Create Playwright test: `__tests__/e2e/[feature-name].spec.js`

**E2E TEST REQUIREMENTS:**
Write a simple Playwright test for visual validation:

- Load the existing page where the component is already rendered
- Take screenshots of the current implementation
- Verify the component appears as expected from the User Story
- Test basic interactions only if they're core to the User Story scenarios
- Report any visual/positioning issues found

**VALIDATION APPROACH:**

- Focus on visual appearance and basic component presence
- Test component renders correctly on different screen sizes
- Verify component is accessible and positioned as expected
- Keep tests simple - complex behavior is covered by unit tests

**DELIVERABLES:**

1. Simple Playwright E2E test file with visual validation
2. Screenshots showing the component appearance across viewports
3. Basic test results - component visibility and positioning

Run: `npx playwright test tests/e2e/[feature-name].spec.js --headed`

If any scenarios fail, document the specific issues for follow-up fixes.
