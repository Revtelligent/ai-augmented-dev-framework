Now that I've reviewed and approved the failing tests, let's move to the GREEN phase.

Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. RED: Write failing tests ← COMPLETED
2. GREEN: Minimal code to pass all tests ← WE ARE HERE
3. REFACTOR: Improve while keeping tests green

GREEN Phase Instructions:

Write the MINIMAL implementation code needed to make ALL the failing tests pass.

**COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION:**

- Create the component(s) with just enough functionality to pass tests
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces/types
- Handle the props and rendering logic tested

**INTEGRATION IMPLEMENTATION:**

- Integrate the component(s) into the application context
- Implement the actual functionality from the user story scenarios
- DO NOT create any new pages or routes or anything that is not clearly defined in the user story and in the red test.
- Add required routing, state management, or API integrations

Focus on making tests pass with the simplest possible implementation.

Show me:

1. All implementation files created or modified
2. Confirmation that both component and integration tests should now pass

Do not optimize yet - we'll do that in the REFACTOR phase.
