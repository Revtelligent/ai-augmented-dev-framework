Now that I've reviewed and approved the failing tests, let's move to the GREEN phase.

Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. RED: Write failing tests ← COMPLETED
2. GREEN: Minimal code to pass all tests ← WE ARE HERE
3. REFACTOR: Improve while keeping tests green

GREEN Phase Instructions:

Write the MINIMAL implementation code needed to make ALL the failing tests pass. This includes:

**COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION:**

- Create the component(s) with just enough functionality to pass the component-level tests
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces/types
- Handle the props and rendering logic tested

**INTEGRATION IMPLEMENTATION:**

- Integrate the component(s) into the application context
- Implement the actual functionality described in the user story scenarios
- Add any required routing, state management, or API integrations
- Ensure performance requirements are met (if specified)

**SUPPORTING CODE:**

- Add any utilities, types, or helpers needed
- Include necessary imports and exports
- Set up any required context providers or configuration

Focus on:

- Making tests pass with the simplest possible implementation
- Avoid over-engineering - just enough to turn tests green
- Maintain clean, readable code structure
- Follow established project patterns and conventions

Show me:

1. All implementation files created or modified
2. Explanation of how each piece makes the tests pass
3. Any assumptions made during implementation
4. Confirmation that both component and integration tests should now pass

Do not optimize or refactor yet - we'll do that in the REFACTOR phase. The goal is minimal working code that passes all tests.
