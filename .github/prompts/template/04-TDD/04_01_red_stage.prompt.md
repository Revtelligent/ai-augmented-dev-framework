I have provided you with a specific User Story and Scenarios from our Product Requirements document.

Please implement: [USER_STORY_NAME]

I want to use strict test-driven development. Write the failing tests first, then we'll write code to make them pass. Do not write any implementation code until I've reviewed the tests.

RED Phase - Write failing tests at TWO levels:

**COMPONENT TEST:**

- Test the main component in isolation
- Mock external dependencies

**INTEGRATION TEST:**

- Test the component working in the actual application
- Test the real user functionality from the scenarios

Show me:

1. Both test files
2. Why each test will fail
3. Expected error messages

Do not write any implementation code yet.
