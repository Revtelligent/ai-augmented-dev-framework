I have provided you with a Product Requirements document (PRD). Please analyze the User Story: [STORY_NAME] and implement it using strict test-driven development.

I want to use strict test-driven development. Please write the failing test first, then we'll write code to make it pass. Do not write any implementation code until I've reviewed the test.

Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly:

1. RED: Write a failing test ‚Üê WE ARE HERE
2. GREEN: Minimal code to pass
3. REFACTOR: Improve while keeping tests green

Start with step 1 only - RED phase.

Write failing tests for the User Story. Show me:

1. The test code (with appropriate test framework)
2. Why it will fail (what's missing)
3. What error message we'd expect to see

Test-First Reasoning:
Before writing any implementation, walk me through:

- What specific behavior should this test verify from the user story?
- What would make this test pass (at a high level)?
- What assumptions am I making about the interface/API?
- How does this test validate the acceptance criteria?

Do not write any implementation code yet.
