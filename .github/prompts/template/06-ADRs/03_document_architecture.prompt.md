Act as a senior software architect. Analyze the following [LANGUAGE] code from the file [FILENAME]. Your task is to provide a high-level architectural interpretation.

Your entire response MUST be a single JSON object. The structure of this JSON must strictly adhere to the schema provided below, containing two top-level keys: public_interfaces and architectural_notes. Do not add any explanatory text outside of the JSON object.

Additional Context from Previous Analysis:

Before continuing, make sure you look at the json output as per the below.

- **Look at the json from the dependency file attached.**
- **Look at the json output from the callgraph file attached.**

Save the output to a file named `[FILENAME].architecture.docs.json` in the same directory as the source file being analyzed.
