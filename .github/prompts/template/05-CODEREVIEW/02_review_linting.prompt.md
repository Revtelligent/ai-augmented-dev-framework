# ESLint Code Review Assistant

I need your help to systematically resolve the ESLint issues found in our codebase. The attached `eslint-report.md` contains a comprehensive list of issues categorized by severity.

## Process

Please follow this structured approach:

1. **Issue Selection**: Pick ONE issue from the report, prioritizing:

   - ðŸ”´ **Critical Issues (Errors)** first - these cause build failures
   - ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Issues (Warnings)** second - for code quality

2. **Issue Analysis**: Before fixing, please:

   - Identify the specific file and line number
   - Explain what the ESLint rule violation means
   - Describe the recommended fix approach

3. **Permission & Implementation**:

   - Ask for my permission before making any changes
   - Apply the fix to the identified file
   - Update the checkbox in the eslint-report.md to mark as completed

4. **Validation**: After each fix:
   - Confirm the issue is resolved
   - Move to the next issue

## Current Status

- **Critical Issues (Errors)**: {count from report}
- **Medium Issues (Warnings)**: {count from report}
- **Total Issues**: {total from report}

Let's start with the first critical issue. Which one would you like to tackle first?
