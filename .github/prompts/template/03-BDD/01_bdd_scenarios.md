**Selected User Stories from PRD:** 
[[Copy and paste 2-3 specific user stories from your PRD, including their acceptance criteria. For example:

**US-1: Access Story Content** > As David, I want to tap a story icon on a planet, so that I can get engaging content for my students.

**Acceptance Criteria:** - GIVEN I am viewing a planet on the main screen WHEN I tap the "Story" icon THEN a new view opens containing the story. - GIVEN the story view is open WHEN I tap the "close" button THEN the view is dismissed and I am returned to the previous screen. - GIVEN I am viewing a celestial object that does not have a story THEN the "Story" icon is not displayed.]]

**Product Context:**

- **Feature Name:** [[Feature name from PRD]]
- **User Persona:** [Brief persona description or name]
- **Technical Platform:** [Web app/Mobile app/Desktop - specify your platform]

</context>
<role>
You are a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer and BDD Specialist with expertise in translating business requirements into comprehensive, testable behavioral scenarios.
</role>
<action>
Based on the provided user stories and acceptance criteria, generate comprehensive BDD scenarios in Gherkin format. For each user story, create:

1. **Happy Path Scenario**: The primary success flow
2. **Edge Case Scenarios**: Boundary conditions and unusual but valid inputs
3. **Error/Failure Scenarios**: What happens when things go wrong
4. **Integration Scenarios**: How this feature interacts with other system components

### Coverage Requirements:

- Cover all acceptance criteria provided in the context
- Include scenarios for data validation and input handling
- Consider mobile/responsive behavior if applicable
- Include scenarios for loading states and error conditions
- Think about accessibility and user experience edge cases

</action>
<format>
Structure your response in Gherkin format using proper BDD syntax. Organize by user story:

## BDD Scenarios for [Feature Name]

### User Story 1: [Story Title]

**Feature: [Feature Name]**
**Scenario: [Happy Path Scenario Name]**
Given [initial state/precondition]
When [user action]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional verification]

**Scenario: [Edge Case Scenario Name]**
Given [boundary condition setup]
When [edge case action]
Then [expected edge case behavior]

**Scenario: [Error Scenario Name]**
Given [error condition setup]
When [action that triggers error]
Then [expected error handling]
And [user should see appropriate feedback]

[Repeat for each user story, generating 3-5 scenarios per story]

### Summary

**Total Scenarios Generated:** [Number]
**Coverage Analysis:**

- Happy Path: [Number] scenarios
- Edge Cases: [Number] scenarios
- Error Handling: [Number] scenarios
- Integration: [Number] scenarios

<definition_of_done>

- Generate at least 3 scenarios per user story (happy path, edge case, error scenario)
- All scenarios must use proper Gherkin syntax (Given/When/Then/And/But)
- Each scenario must be specific and testable
- Cover all acceptance criteria provided in the context
- Include realistic data and system states in the scenarios
- Scenarios should be independent and not rely on each other
