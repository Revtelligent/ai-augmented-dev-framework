```

## Data Model Rationale

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **JSON Storage for Flexibility**: Used JSON columns for challenge metadata and game_data to accommodate different challenge types without schema changes, leveraging SQLite 3.40+ JSON1 extension for efficient querying.

- **Session Token Management**: Implemented secure session tokens with automatic expiration after 24 hours via triggers, supporting the security requirement for session management and enabling seamless session recovery.

- **Normalized Challenge Design**: Separated challenges from sessions to enable efficient challenge browsing (read-heavy operations) while maintaining data integrity and supporting the filtering requirements by time and difficulty.

- **Tutorial Progress Tracking**: Created dedicated tutorial_progress table with UNIQUE constraint on user_id to ensure each user has only one tutorial record, supporting the 70% completion rate analytics requirement.

**Performance Considerations:**

- **Partial Indexes**: Used partial indexes with WHERE clauses on active challenges and in-progress sessions to optimize the most common queries while reducing index size and maintenance overhead.

- **Composite Indexes**: Created composite indexes on frequently queried field combinations (user_id + created_at, status + priority) to support sub-500ms response times for challenge selection and session management.

- **Read Optimization**: Designed indexes to support read-heavy operations like challenge selection and leaderboard queries, with sort_order on challenges table for efficient display ordering.

**Future Extensibility:**

- **JSON Metadata Fields**: The flexible JSON storage in challenges.metadata and sessions.game_data allows for easy addition of new challenge types and gameplay mechanics without schema migrations.

- **Extensible Status Enums**: Status fields use CHECK constraints that can be easily expanded to support additional states like 'paused', 'multiplayer', or 'tournament' modes.

- **Feedback System Foundation**: The user_feedback table provides a foundation for implementing more sophisticated feedback categorization, automated issue routing, and user satisfaction tracking.

- **Analytics Ready**: The schema captures all necessary data points for advanced analytics including completion rates, time-to-completion distributions, difficulty progression patterns, and user engagement metrics.

**Data Privacy & Retention Compliance:**

- **Minimal PII Collection**: Schema focuses on gameplay data rather than personal information, with only necessary foreign key references to existing users table.

- **90-Day Retention Support**: Session and feedback timestamps enable automated cleanup procedures to maintain 90-day retention policy for analytics data while preserving user privacy.

- **Secure Token Management**: Session tokens are designed to expire automatically, and the schema supports secure session management without storing sensitive authentication data.

<role>
You are a seasoned Backend API Engineer who excels at designing clean, efficient, and RESTful APIs based on product specs and data models.
</role>
<action>
Based on the provided user stories, functional requirements, design considerations, and data model, define the necessary RESTful API endpoints to power the feature. Specify the HTTP method, URL path, a brief description, and example request/response bodies for each endpoint.

### Technical Constraints

- REST API following standard REST conventions with proper HTTP verbs and status codes
- Authentication: JWT Bearer token-based authentication with 24-hour token expiration
- Rate limiting: 10 requests per minute per user (per NFR), 1,000 requests/second system capacity
- Response format: JSON with consistent error handling and standardized error response format
- Versioning strategy: URL versioning (/api/v1/) for clear API evolution and backward compatibility
- Performance targets: 500ms response time for 95% of requests, 99.5% uptime during business hours
- Error handling: Consistent JSON error response format with error codes, messages, and actionable details

</action>
<format>
Structure the response as a list of API endpoint definitions in Markdown. Use the following format for each endpoint:

### [HTTP_METHOD] /api/v1/[resource]

- **Description:** [A 1-sentence explanation of what this endpoint does.]
- **Authentication:** [Required/Optional - specify auth requirements]
- **Rate Limit:** [Specific limits for this endpoint if different from global]

- **Example Request Body:**

```json
// (Show only if applicable, e.g., for POST/PUT)
{
  "key": "value",
  "timestamp": "2023-12-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

- **Example Success Response (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "key": "value",
  "created_at": "2023-12-01T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-12-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

- **Example Error Response (400 Bad Request):**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
    "message": "Description of what went wrong",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

---

[Repeat for all necessary endpoints, such as GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE for each resource.]

### API Design Summary

**Base URL:**

- https://api.yourdomain.com/v1
  **Common Headers:**

- Authorization: Bearer <token> (if using JWT)
- Content-Type: application/json
- Accept: application/json

**Standard Error Codes:**

400 - Bad Request (validation errors)
401 - Unauthorized (authentication required)
403 - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
404 - Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
429 - Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
500 - Internal Server Error

**Pagination Format (for list endpoints):**

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total": 100,
    "pages": 5
  }
}
```

</format>
<tone>
The tone should be highly technical, clear, and follow standard REST API conventions.Include comprehensive documentation for developer consumption.
</tone>
