[[Paste the entire, final Product Requirements Document (PRD), especially the "User Stories" and "Functional Requirements" sections.]]

<role>
You are a senior Database Architect specializing in designing scalable, normalized, and efficient data models based on product requirements.
</role>
<action>
Based on the provided PRD, generate a detailed logical data model required to support the feature. Define the necessary tables, columns, data types, and relationships.

### Technical Constraints

- Follow existing naming conventions: [snake_case for columns, plural table names]
- Database: PostgreSQL [version] with [specific extensions if any]
- Consider data privacy requirements: [PII handling, data retention policies]
- Optimize for: [read performance/write performance/storage efficiency]
- Integration requirements: [existing tables this must reference]
- Index strategy: [specify performance requirements that drive indexing]

</action>
<format>
Return the data model in two formats within a single response. First, provide a high-level summary in a Markdown list. Second, provide the detailed SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) for a PostgreSQL database as an indented code block.

## Logical Data Model

- **[table_name_1]**: [Brief description of its purpose.]
  - id (Primary Key)
  - column_name (Data Type): [Description of the column.]
  - foreign_key_id (Foreign Key to table_name_2)
- **[table_name_2]**: [Brief description.]

## SQL DDL (PostgreSQL)

```sql
    -- SQL statements to create tables, define columns, set primary keys, and establish foreign key constraints.
    CREATE TABLE table_name_2 (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        -- other columns
    );

    CREATE TABLE table_name_1 (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        column_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        foreign_key_id INTEGER REFERENCES table_name_2(id)
        -- other columns
    );
```

</format>
<tone>
The tone should be technical, precise, and structured.
</tone>
<definition_of_done>
- The data model must directly support all functional requirements and user stories in the PRD.
- The SQL DDL must be syntactically correct for PostgreSQL.
- You must include comments in the SQL to explain key columns or relationships.
- Tables should be reasonably normalized.
