<examples>
Here are examples of high-quality feedback from each perspective:

**Product Manager Feedback Example:**
"The 'User completes challenge' scenario covers the happy path well, but we're missing the critical business rule for handling partial progress when users hit their daily time limit. This could impact our engagement metrics since 40% of our target users (busy professionals) have strict time constraints. We need a scenario that validates the 'Save and Resume Later' functionality aligns with our goal of 70% tutorial completion rate."

**Developer Feedback Example:**
"The performance scenario 'Challenge loads within 500ms' needs technical clarification. The current scenario doesn't specify whether this includes asset download time or just API response time. Given our CDN architecture and the stated requirement of supporting 10,000 concurrent users, we need to separate API response time (100ms) from full page load time (500ms) and test them independently. Also missing: Redis cache hit/miss scenarios for session state management."

**QA Engineer Feedback Example:**
"The error handling scenario for network interruption is good, but we're missing boundary testing around the 24-hour session expiration. We need scenarios that test 23 hours 59 minutes (should work), exactly 24 hours (edge case), and 24 hours 1 minute (should fail). Also, the current scenario doesn't validate that expired sessions are properly cleaned up, which could cause memory leaks in production."
