## 9. Technical Architecture

### 9.1 Data Model Overview

The Quick Play Mode data architecture centers around four core entities designed for scalability and professional use:

- **Challenges:** Store available games/puzzles with metadata including estimated duration, difficulty level, and configuration data
- **Sessions:** Track individual gameplay instances with state management for recovery and analytics
- **Tutorial Progress:** Monitor user onboarding completion for experience optimization
- **Feedback:** Capture user reports and suggestions for continuous improvement

The model emphasizes session state preservation for network interruption recovery and comprehensive analytics collection while maintaining minimal PII collection for privacy compliance.

### 9.2 API Design Overview

RESTful API architecture with JWT authentication and comprehensive rate limiting designed for professional environments:

- **Challenge Management:** Endpoints for discovering and selecting challenges with filtering capabilities
- **Session Management:** Create, update, and complete gameplay sessions with automatic recovery mechanisms
- **Tutorial Tracking:** Progress monitoring and completion status for onboarding optimization
- **Feedback System:** Streamlined reporting mechanism for continuous improvement

All endpoints designed for sub-500ms response times with automatic retry logic and comprehensive error handling suitable for workplace network conditions.

## 10. Out of Scope / Future Considerations

**Version 1.0 Exclusions:**

- Multiplayer or competitive modes (focus on individual professional breaks)
- Complex adaptive AI algorithms (simple rule-based difficulty adjustment only)
- Offline mode capabilities (network dependency acceptable for v1)
- Advanced analytics dashboard for end users (basic performance summary only)
- Integration with external productivity tools (Slack, Teams, etc.)
- Custom challenge creation by users
- Social features or leaderboards

**Future Roadmap Considerations:**

- **Phase 2:** Enhanced adaptive difficulty using machine learning algorithms
- **Phase 3:** Offline mode for unreliable network environments
- **Phase 4:** Enterprise dashboard and analytics for workplace wellness programs
- **Phase 5:** Integration with productivity and wellness platforms
- **Phase 6:** Custom challenge authoring tools for enterprise customers

## 11. Technical Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**High-Priority Risks:**

**Risk 1: Adaptive Difficulty Algorithm Performance**

- **Mitigation:** Implement simple rule-based algorithm initially; pre-calculate difficulty adjustments; ensure calculations complete within 50ms

**Risk 2: Concurrent Session Management at Scale**

- **Impact:** 10,000 concurrent users could overwhelm session state management
- **Mitigation:** Implement stateless architecture with Redis caching; design for 15,000 user capacity (50% buffer); implement connection pooling and circuit breakers

**Risk 3: Cross-Platform Tutorial State Synchronization**

- **Impact:** Tutorial progress could become inconsistent across devices
- **Mitigation:** Centralized state management with PWA capabilities; device-specific rendering with fallbacks; comprehensive cross-platform testing

**Medium-Priority Risks:**

**Risk 4: Integration with Existing MindBreak Architecture**

- **Impact:** Feature could disrupt existing app functionality or performance
- **Mitigation:** Modular implementation with feature flags; comprehensive regression testing; gradual rollout capability

**Risk 5: Security Vulnerabilities in Game State**

- **Impact:** Users could manipulate completion times or scores
- **Mitigation:** Server-side validation with cryptographic signatures; reasonable bounds checking; audit logging for suspicious patterns

</context>
<role>
You are a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer and BDD Specialist with 10+ years of experience in enterprise software testing. You specialize in translating complex business requirements into comprehensive, executable test scenarios, risk-based testing approaches that prioritize business-critical functionality, creating realistic test scenarios that account for technical constraints and system architecture, designing test strategies that balance thorough coverage with practical execution, and writing Gherkin scenarios that are maintainable, readable, and technically accurate.
</role>
<action>
Analyze the provided PRD and generate a comprehensive suite of BDD scenarios in Gherkin format. Your analysis should:

1. **Extract and prioritize** all user stories based on business impact and technical risk
2. **Create systematic coverage** with 4-6 scenarios per critical user story, 3-4 for high priority stories
3. **Generate realistic scenarios** that reflect actual system constraints, API limitations, and performance requirements
4. **Design test scenarios** covering happy paths, edge cases, error conditions, integration points, performance requirements, and security constraints
5. **Organize scenarios** by priority level (P0 Critical, P1 High, P2 Medium, P3 Low) for effective test execution planning

### Coverage Requirements:

- Cover all acceptance criteria from identified user stories
- Include scenarios for stated performance requirements (response times, uptime, etc.)
- Address security and accessibility requirements where applicable
- Consider mobile/responsive behavior and cross-platform compatibility
- Include scenarios for data validation, error handling, and recovery
- Address integration points with existing systems
- Create scenarios for monitoring and analytics requirements

</format>
<tone>
Technical and precise, using standard BDD/Gherkin conventions. Focus on testable, unambiguous language.
</tone>
<examples>
Here are examples of the expected scenario quality and format:

**Example 1: Performance Scenario**
**Scenario: Feature loads within performance requirements**
Given a user with valid authentication credentials
And the system is under normal load conditions
When the user accesses the primary feature
Then the feature loads within the specified response time
And the performance metrics are logged for monitoring
And no client-side errors occur during the loading process

**Example 2: Error Handling Scenario**
**Scenario: System handles network interruption gracefully**
Given a user has an active session with unsaved data
And the session has been active for less than the timeout period
When a network interruption occurs for a brief duration
Then the system attempts automatic reconnection with retry logic
And the user's data is preserved in temporary storage
And the user can resume from the point of interruption
And the recovery process completes within acceptable timeframe

**Example 3: Integration Scenario**
**Scenario: User action triggers downstream system update**
Given a user is performing a business-critical action
And the downstream API endpoint is available
When the user completes the action successfully
Then a request is sent to the appropriate API endpoint
And the request payload contains required data fields
And the API responds with success status within timeout
And the user's action is reflected in the connected system
