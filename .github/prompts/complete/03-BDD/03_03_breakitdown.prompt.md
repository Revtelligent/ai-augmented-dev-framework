**Business Rationale**: Session recovery is essential for user experience and retention during network interruptions
**Technical Considerations**: State preservation requires Redis caching and automatic recovery within 30 seconds

**Feature: Session Recovery and Interruption Handling**

**Scenario: User resumes session after brief network interruption**

```gherkin
Given Alex Carter has an active Quick Play Mode session
And Alex is 2 minutes into a 4-minute Memory Match challenge
And Alex has unsaved progress (score: 150, level: 3)
When a network interruption occurs for 10 seconds
Then the system preserves session state in Redis cache
And the system attempts automatic reconnection up to 3 times
And session recovery completes within 30 seconds of reconnection
And Alex can resume from the exact point of interruption
And all progress (score, level, time) is intact
```

**Scenario: User returns to interrupted session within 24-hour window**

```gherkin
Given Alex Carter's Quick Play Mode session was interrupted yesterday
And the session was interrupted with 1 minute remaining
And less than 24 hours have passed since interruption
When Alex returns to MindBreak and accesses Quick Play Mode
Then Alex sees option to "Resume Previous Session"
And session loads within 30 seconds with all progress intact
And game state matches exactly the point of interruption
And session token is validated and refreshed appropriately
```

**Scenario: Session recovery fails gracefully when session expires**

```gherkin
Given Alex Carter had an interrupted Quick Play Mode session
And more than 24 hours have passed since the interruption
When Alex returns to MindBreak and accesses Quick Play Mode

And submission completes within 2 seconds
```

**Scenario: User tracks feedback status updates**

```gherkin
Given Alex Carter has submitted feedback about a technical issue
And the feedback has been assigned ticket ID FB-2025-001
When Alex views their submitted feedback history
Then Alex can see feedback status (submitted, in_review, resolved, closed)
And Alex can view timestamps for each status change
And Alex receives notifications for status updates
And feedback history is accessible from user profile section
```

**Scenario: Feedback rate limiting prevents spam submissions**

```gherkin
Given Alex Carter has submitted feedback in the Quick Play Mode
And Alex attempts to submit additional feedback immediately
When Alex tries to submit more than 5 feedback items within 1 minute
Then the system enforces rate limiting of 5 submissions per minute
And Alex receives clear message about rate limiting
And subsequent submissions are queued for after rate limit resets
And system logs rate limiting events for abuse monitoring
```

**Scenario: Feedback submission during offline state**

```gherkin
Given Alex Carter wants to submit feedback about Quick Play Mode
And Alex loses internet connectivity while completing feedback form
When Alex attempts to submit the completed feedback form
Then the feedback is stored locally for automatic submission
And Alex receives confirmation that feedback will be sent when online
And system automatically submits stored feedback upon reconnection
And Alex receives confirmation of successful submission after sync

<role>
You are a Test Automation Architect specializing in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). Your core responsibility is to structure test assets for optimal integration into a CI/CD pipeline and test automation framework (e.g., Cucumber, Behave, SpecFlow). You excel at converting consolidated test suites into well-formed, independently executable .feature files that can be run by standard BDD test runners.
</role>

<action>
Your task is to parse the provided consolidated BDD scenarios document and split it into multiple, individual Gherkin .feature files. Each user story identified in the document must become its own distinct .feature file.

**Identify User Stories**: Systematically scan the document for user story boundaries using these patterns:

- Headers containing "US-" followed by a number (e.g., "### US-1:", "## US-2:", "US-3:")
- Section breaks that clearly separate different user stories
- Be flexible with markdown heading levels (##, ###, ####, etc.)
- Look for story titles that follow patterns like "US-X: [Story Description]"
- If no clear US- pattern exists, group related scenarios by logical feature boundaries

**Extract Story Content**: For each identified user story:

- Feature Name: Extract or derive from the user story title
- Metadata: Capture priority, business rationale, technical considerations if present
- Scenarios: Extract all scenarios associated with this story, whether in code blocks, plain text, or mixed formatting
- Scenario Structure: Ensure each scenario follows proper Gherkin syntax with Given/When/Then steps

**Generate Filenames**: Create clean, filesystem-friendly filenames using these rules:

- Start with user story ID in lowercase: "us*1*", "us*2*", etc.
- Convert story title to snake_case (spaces to underscores, remove special characters, lowercase)
- Limit to 50 characters before .feature extension
- Examples: "US-1: User Login Flow" → us_1_user_login_flow.feature

**Format as .feature Files**: Present each extracted feature as a complete, valid Gherkin file with proper comment block structure and all associated scenarios.

**Handle Edge Cases**:

- Use placeholders for missing metadata (Priority: "TBD", Business Rationale: "See requirements document")
- Convert malformed scenarios to valid Gherkin syntax while preserving intent
- Make logical groupings if user story boundaries are unclear
- Generate descriptive scenario names if missing

</action>

<format>
Structure your response as a series of distinct code blocks. Each code block represents one complete .feature file. Do not include any text or explanation between the code blocks unless there are critical parsing issues that need clarification.

Follow this exact format for each file:

<!-- FILENAME: [generated_snake_case_filename.feature] -->

# [User Story ID]: [User Story Title]

# Priority: [P0/P1/P2/P3 or "TBD" if not specified]

# Business Rationale: [Copy from source if available, otherwise "See requirements document"]

# Technical Considerations: [Copy from source if available, otherwise "See technical specifications"]

Feature: [Feature Name derived from story title]

Scenario: [Scenario Name]
Given [precondition steps]
When [action steps]
Then [expected outcome steps]
And [additional assertion steps]

[Additional scenarios for this user story...]

**Quality Standards:**

- Each file must contain valid Gherkin syntax ready for test execution
- All scenarios belonging to a user story must be included in its corresponding file
- Filename must be filesystem-safe and descriptive
- Given/When/Then step content must be preserved exactly from source document
- If scenarios are in code blocks, extract and format as proper Gherkin
  </format>

<examples>
Here are examples of the expected output for different user stories:

<!-- FILENAME: us_1_user_authentication.feature -->

# US-1: User Authentication

# Priority: P0

# Business Rationale: Secure user authentication is critical for protecting user data and system integrity

# Technical Considerations: Must integrate with existing OAuth 2.0 infrastructure and support multi-factor authentication

And the user has valid account credentials
When the user enters their username and password
And the user clicks the login button
Then the user is redirected to the dashboard
And the user session is established
And the login attempt is logged for security monitoring

Scenario: User login fails with invalid credentials
Given the user is on the login page
When the user enters invalid username or password
And the user clicks the login button
Then an error message is displayed
And the user remains on the login page
And the failed login attempt is logged for security monitoring

<!-- FILENAME: us_2_data_export.feature -->

# US-2: Data Export Functionality

# Priority: P1

# Business Rationale: Users need ability to export their data to comply with data portability requirements

# Technical Considerations: Export must handle large datasets efficiently and support multiple file formats

Feature: Data Export

Scenario: User exports data in CSV format
Given the user is logged into the system
And the user has data available for export
When the user navigates to the export section
And the user selects CSV format
And the user clicks the export button
Then a CSV file is generated within 30 seconds
And the file contains all user data in proper format
And the user receives a download link via email

Scenario: User exports data in JSON format
Given the user is logged into the system
And the user has data available for export
When the user navigates to the export section
And the user selects JSON format
And the user clicks the export button
Then a JSON file is generated within 30 seconds

And the user receives a download link via email
</examples>

<definition_of_done>
**Mandatory Requirements:**

- The output must contain one code block for every user story found in the input document
- Each code block must be preceded by an HTML comment specifying the filename in the format: <!-- FILENAME: [filename.feature] -->
- Filenames must be lowercase, use underscores for spaces, and end with the .feature extension
- The content of each code block must be valid Gherkin syntax, starting with comment block and Feature: line
- All scenarios belonging to a user story must be included in its corresponding file
- Given/When/Then step content must be preserved exactly from the source document
- There should be no extraneous text outside of the specified file format (unless critical parsing issues exist)

**Quality Standards:**

- Each .feature file must be immediately usable by a standard BDD test automation framework (Cucumber, Behave, SpecFlow)
