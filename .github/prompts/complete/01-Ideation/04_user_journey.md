### Journey Optimization Opportunities

[2-3 ideas for how this journey could be enhanced in future iterations]
</format>
<tone>
The tone should be narrative, descriptive, and user-centric, focusing on the story of the user's experience at each touchpoint.
</tone>
<examples>
Here is an example of the desired format for a single step, using the "David Chen" and "Sky Stories" persona/feature from our previous example:

1.  **Discovery:** While preparing for a class, David is exploring the app. He points his phone at Jupiter and sees the standard information pop up. Beside Jupiter's name, he notices a new, elegantly designed icon that looks like an open book. Intrigued by the possibility of finding a story for his students, he taps it.
    </examples>
    <definition_of_done>

- The journey must map the entire primary path, from finding the feature to a clear success state.
- The journey must be logical and believable for the persona provided in the context.
- The journey should consist of at least 5 distinct steps.
- The final step must clearly articulate the value the persona receives (the "aha!" moment) and how it solves one of their core frustrations.
