# US-5: Provide Feedback

# Priority: P1

# Business Rationale: User feedback drives continuous improvement and technical issue resolution

# Technical Considerations: Feedback system must handle rate limiting and integrate with session context

Feature: User Feedback and Issue Reporting

  Scenario: User reports technical issue with session context
    Given Alex Carter encounters a technical issue during Quick Play Mode
    And Alex is in an active session (session_id: qps_123abc)
    When Alex accesses the feedback option from the game interface
    Then a streamlined feedback form appears with predefined categories
    And categories include "technical_issue", "bug_report", "suggestion"
    And the form pre-populates with current session context
    And Alex can submit feedback within 5 form fields
    And submission completes within 2 seconds

  Scenario: User tracks feedback status updates
    Given Alex Carter has submitted feedback about a technical issue
    And the feedback has been assigned ticket ID FB-2025-001
    When Alex views their submitted feedback history
    Then Alex can see feedback status (submitted, in_review, resolved, closed)
    And Alex can view timestamps for each status change
    And Alex receives notifications for status updates
    And feedback history is accessible from user profile section

  Scenario: Feedback rate limiting prevents spam submissions
    Given Alex Carter has submitted feedback in the Quick Play Mode
    And Alex attempts to submit additional feedback immediately
    When Alex tries to submit more than 5 feedback items within 1 minute
    Then the system enforces rate limiting of 5 submissions per minute
    And Alex receives clear message about rate limiting
    And subsequent submissions are queued for after rate limit resets
    And system logs rate limiting events for abuse monitoring

  Scenario: Feedback submission during offline state
    Given Alex Carter wants to submit feedback about Quick Play Mode
    And Alex loses internet connectivity while completing feedback form
    When Alex attempts to submit the completed feedback form
    Then the feedback is stored locally for automatic submission
    And Alex receives confirmation that feedback will be sent when online
    And system automatically submits stored feedback upon reconnection
    And Alex receives confirmation of successful submission after sync
