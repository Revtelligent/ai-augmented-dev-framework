Feature: Challenge Selection and Gameplay

  Scenario: User views challenge selection with accurate metadata
    Given Alex Carter accesses the Quick Play Mode game selection screen
    And challenges are available in the system
    When the challenge selection screen loads
    Then each challenge displays estimated completion time (2-5 minutes range)
    And each challenge shows difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
    And each challenge includes clear visual distinction
    And challenge metadata loads within 500ms for 95% of requests
    And mobile displays 2-3 challenges optimally
    And desktop displays 4-6 challenges without cognitive overload

  Scenario: User starts challenge with clear instructions
    Given Alex Carter views the available challenges on selection screen
    And Alex selects a specific challenge (Memory Match - Medium difficulty)
    When Alex starts the selected challenge
    Then gameplay begins within 3 seconds
    And clear, concise instructions are displayed
    And game interface loads completely without errors
    And session token is generated securely with 24-hour expiration
    And session state is initialized in the system

  Scenario: User completes challenge and views performance summary
    Given Alex Carter is playing an active Quick Play Mode challenge
    And Alex has been playing for 3 minutes and 45 seconds
    When Alex successfully completes the challenge
    Then performance summary displays within 1 second
    And summary shows completion time, score, and personal best comparison
    And "Play Again" option is prominently displayed
    And "Return to Selection" option is available
    And challenge completion is recorded in user analytics
    And adaptive difficulty algorithm updates based on performance

  Scenario: Challenge filtering works correctly
    Given Alex Carter is on the challenge selection screen
    And multiple challenges exist with different difficulties and durations
    When Alex applies filter for "Easy" difficulty challenges
    Then only Easy difficulty challenges are displayed
    And challenge count updates to reflect filtered results
    When Alex applies filter for "Under 3 minutes" duration
    Then only challenges with estimated duration under 3 minutes are shown
    And filters can be combined (Easy AND Under 3 minutes)
    And filter application completes within 200ms

  Scenario: System handles high concurrent challenge selection load
    Given the system is experiencing peak usage with 1,000 concurrent users
    And Alex Carter attempts to select a challenge during peak time
    When Alex navigates to challenge selection screen
    Then challenge list loads within 500ms despite high load
    And challenge selection API maintains 99.5% uptime
    And session creation succeeds without errors
    And Redis caching reduces backend load by 80% for challenge metadata
    And system maintains responsive performance under load

  Scenario: Error handling during challenge gameplay
    Given Alex Carter is actively playing a Quick Play Mode challenge
    And Alex encounters a technical issue during gameplay
    When the technical issue occurs (network timeout, client error)
    Then Alex sees user-friendly error message without technical jargon
    And Alex can access streamlined feedback form with predefined categories
    And session state is preserved for potential recovery
    And error details are logged with session context for debugging
    And Alex can return to challenge selection without data loss
