# US-4: Resume Interrupted Sessions

# Priority: P1

# Business Rationale: Session recovery is essential for user experience and retention during network interruptions

# Technical Considerations: State preservation requires Redis caching and automatic recovery within 30 seconds

Feature: Session Recovery and Interruption Handling

  Scenario: User resumes session after brief network interruption
    Given Alex Carter has an active Quick Play Mode session
    And Alex is 2 minutes into a 4-minute Memory Match challenge
    And Alex has unsaved progress (score: 150, level: 3)
    When a network interruption occurs for 10 seconds
    Then the system preserves session state in Redis cache
    And the system attempts automatic reconnection up to 3 times
    And session recovery completes within 30 seconds of reconnection
    And Alex can resume from the exact point of interruption
    And all progress (score, level, time) is intact

  Scenario: User returns to interrupted session within 24-hour window
    Given Alex Carter's Quick Play Mode session was interrupted yesterday
    And the session was interrupted with 1 minute remaining
    And less than 24 hours have passed since interruption
    When Alex returns to MindBreak and accesses Quick Play Mode
    Then Alex sees option to "Resume Previous Session"
    And session loads within 30 seconds with all progress intact
    And game state matches exactly the point of interruption
    And session token is validated and refreshed appropriately

  Scenario: Session recovery fails gracefully when session expires
    Given Alex Carter had an interrupted Quick Play Mode session
    And more than 24 hours have passed since the interruption
    When Alex returns to MindBreak and accesses Quick Play Mode
    Then Alex receives notification that previous session has expired
    And Alex is directed to challenge selection screen
    And no corrupted session data remains in the system
    And Alex can start a new session without issues
    And expired session data is cleaned up automatically

  Scenario: Multiple device session conflict resolution
    Given Alex Carter starts a Quick Play Mode session on mobile device
    And Alex has an active session token for the challenge
    When Alex attempts to start the same challenge on desktop device
    Then the system detects multiple session conflict
    And Alex receives prompt to choose which session to continue
    And the selected session becomes active while other is terminated
    And session state synchronizes correctly to the chosen device

  Scenario: Session recovery under high server load
    Given the system is under high load with 8,000 concurrent users
    And Alex Carter's session was interrupted during peak usage
    When Alex attempts to recover the interrupted session
    Then session recovery completes within 30 seconds despite high load
    And Redis cache performs optimally under concurrent recovery requests
    And session data integrity is maintained during high-load recovery
    And system maintains 99.5% uptime during peak recovery periods
