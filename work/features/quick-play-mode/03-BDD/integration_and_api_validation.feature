Feature: Integration and API Validation

  Scenario: Challenge metadata API integration
    Given the Quick Play Mode challenge selection screen loads
    When the system requests challenge data from the API
    Then GET /api/v1/challenges responds within 100ms
    And response includes all required fields (id, name, difficulty, duration)
    And response format matches OpenAPI specification
    And error handling follows RESTful conventions
    And rate limiting headers are properly included

  Scenario: Session creation API workflow
    Given Alex Carter selects a challenge to play
    When the system creates a new session via POST /api/v1/quick-play-sessions
    Then request includes challenge_id and user authentication
    And response returns session_token within 200ms
    And session data is stored securely in database
    And Redis cache is updated for fast session retrieval
    And session metrics are logged for analytics
