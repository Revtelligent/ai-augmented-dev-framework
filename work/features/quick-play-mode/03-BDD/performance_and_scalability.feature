# Performance and Scalability

# Priority: P1

# Business Rationale: System performance directly impacts user satisfaction and business scalability

# Technical Considerations: Must support 10,000 concurrent users with global CDN performance requirements

Feature: Performance and Scalability

  Scenario: Concurrent user load testing
    Given the system supports 10,000 concurrent Quick Play Mode users
    When all users simultaneously access challenge selection
    Then system maintains sub-500ms response times for 95% of requests
    And database connection pooling handles concurrent queries efficiently
    And Redis caching reduces database load by minimum 80%
    And no user experiences session creation failures
    And system auto-scaling triggers appropriately under load

  Scenario: CDN performance for global users
    Given Alex Carter accesses Quick Play Mode from different global locations
    When Alex loads challenge assets and game resources
    Then CDN delivers content within 2 seconds globally for 95% of users
    And content is properly cached at edge locations
    And cache invalidation works correctly for updated content
    And geographic routing optimizes content delivery paths
