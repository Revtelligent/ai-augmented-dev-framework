# System Resilience

# Priority: P2

# Business Rationale: Ensuring system stability and graceful degradation during failures

# Technical Considerations: Must handle API failures and database connectivity issues without complete system failure

Feature: System Resilience

  Scenario: API endpoint failure graceful degradation
    Given Alex Carter is using Quick Play Mode
    And the challenge selection API endpoint becomes temporarily unavailable
    When Alex attempts to load challenges
    Then cached challenge data is displayed from local storage
    And Alex receives notification about limited functionality
    And system automatically retries API connection every 30 seconds
    And full functionality resumes when API becomes available

  Scenario: Database connection failure during active session
    Given Alex Carter is actively playing a Quick Play Mode challenge
    And database connectivity is lost during gameplay
    When Alex completes actions that require database writes
    Then actions are queued locally for later synchronization
    And Alex can continue playing without immediate interruption
    And queued actions are processed once database connection resumes
    And data integrity is maintained throughout the recovery process
