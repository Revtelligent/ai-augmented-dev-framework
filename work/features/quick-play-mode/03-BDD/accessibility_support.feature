Feature: Accessibility Support

  Scenario: Screen reader compatibility with Quick Play Mode
    Given Alex Carter uses a screen reader for accessibility
    When Alex navigates Quick Play Mode features
    Then all interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
    And screen reader announces game state changes appropriately
    And navigation follows logical tab order
    And alternative text descriptions are provided for visual elements
