# Security and Authorization

# Priority: P0

# Business Rationale: Security is fundamental to protecting user data and maintaining system integrity

# Technical Considerations: Must implement JWT token security, session validation, and prevent client-side manipulation

Feature: Security and Authorization

  Scenario: Session token security validation
    Given Alex Carter has an active Quick Play Mode session
    And the session has a valid JWT token with expiration
    When Alex attempts to access session-protected endpoints
    Then all requests include proper Bearer token authentication
    And expired tokens are rejected with 401 Unauthorized response
    And token refresh occurs automatically when near expiration
    And session activity extends token validity appropriately

  Scenario: Game state manipulation prevention
    Given Alex Carter is playing a Quick Play Mode challenge
    And Alex attempts to manipulate client-side game state
    When Alex modifies score or completion data on client
    Then server-side validation rejects invalid state changes
    And cryptographic signatures validate all game state transitions
    And audit logs capture attempted manipulation events
    And Alex's session is flagged for security review if needed
