# Technical Considerations: Must maintain functionality and performance across various device specifications

Feature: Cross-Platform Compatibility

  Scenario: Tutorial experience consistency across platforms
    Given Alex Carter accesses Quick Play Mode tutorial on different platforms
    When Alex starts tutorial on mobile and later continues on desktop
    Then tutorial progress synchronizes correctly across devices
    And visual presentation adapts appropriately to each platform
    And functionality remains consistent regardless of device
    And tutorial completion status updates universally

  Scenario: Challenge performance on low-end devices
    Given Alex Carter uses Quick Play Mode on a lower-end mobile device
    And the device has limited RAM (2GB) and slower CPU
    When Alex selects and plays challenges
    Then challenges load within acceptable timeframes (under 5 seconds)
    And gameplay remains smooth without significant lag
    And memory usage stays within reasonable limits
    And battery consumption is optimized for extended play
